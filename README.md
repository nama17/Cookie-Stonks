### Userscript Manager _(Recommended)_

For Google Chrome or Edge, [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) is the one you need.

2. In this page, click on [main.user.js](main.user.js). A new page will load showing its code. Click on the **Raw** button.

3. Your user script manager will prompt you to confirm the installation.

### Bookmark _(Needs to be manually opened each time)_

1. Add a new bookmark with whatever name you want and paste this as the URL:
```
javascript:(function(){var script=document.createElement('script');script.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');script.setAttribute('src','https://combinatronics.com/worldwidewaves/Cookie-Stonks/main/main.user.js');document.body.appendChild(script);}());
```
2. Open Cookie Clicker and click on the bookmark.
